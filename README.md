#TypeScript React Example

TypeScript 1.6 comes with full-featured support for Facebook React ([release note](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/typescript/archive/2015/09/16/announcing-typescript-1-6.aspx)).

I rewrite the comments box example in [React tutorial](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/tutorial.html) as an example of how to start writing React application using TypeScript 1.6.
